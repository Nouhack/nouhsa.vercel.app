## Overview

The **LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)** project involved building an integration between the hospital management system (built with **Odoo**) and laboratory equipment using a **TCP/IP socket**. The integration allows seamless communication and data transfer between the hospital's management system and various laboratory devices, improving the overall efficiency of laboratory operations.

## Key Features

- **Odoo Integration**: Connected the hospital management system (HMS) built on **Odoo** to laboratory equipment, enabling real-time data exchange.
- **TCP/IP Socket Communication**: Established reliable communication between the HMS and lab devices for smooth transfer of patient results and laboratory data.
- **Automated Data Handling**: Simplified the process of collecting and managing lab results, reducing manual data entry and human error.

## Technologies Used

- **Odoo**: For the hospital management system.
- **TCP/IP Socket**: To establish communication between laboratory equipment and the HMS.
- **Python**: For developing the server-side logic and socket communication.

## Outcome

The LIMS integration enabled efficient management of laboratory data and patient results, streamlining laboratory operations and improving data accuracy.

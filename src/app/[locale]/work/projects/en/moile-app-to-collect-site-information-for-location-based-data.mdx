## Overview

Development of **Locatic**, a mobile React Native app designed to collect site information for location-based data. The project included creating a polished design prototype and an intuitive user experience.

## Key Features

- **Design Prototype**: Built the design prototype in **Figma**, starting with the selection of a beautiful, harmonious color palette to create a visually appealing interface.
- **Embedded Database**: Used **RealmDB** for efficient and secure local data storage, ensuring seamless offline functionality and fast data synchronization.
- **Location-Based Data Collection**: Enabled precise capturing of site-specific information with geolocation support and customizable forms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Focused on creating an intuitive, responsive UI tailored for field data collectors.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Figma**: To design and refine the app's user interface and experience.
- **RealmDB**: For embedding a lightweight, fast, and secure database within the app.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and app functionality implementation.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Design Iterations**: Collaborating in Figma allowed rapid iterations and refinements before moving to the coding phase, ensuring that the design was user-centric and aligned with project goals.
- **Database Optimization**: Implementing RealmDB presented initial challenges with schema design but ultimately provided the required performance and reliability for local data storage.
- **Color Palette Selection**: Choosing the right color palette was a creative challenge that significantly enhanced the overall user experience and visual appeal.

## Outcome

Locatic is now an effective tool for location-based data collection, offering a seamless and visually appealing experience. The app's intuitive design, coupled with powerful offline capabilities, has made it a valuable resource for field operations, empowering users to collect and manage site-specific information efficiently.
